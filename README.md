# Integrative Workflow Design for Enhanced Large Language Model Processing

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated workflow integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with a calculator and a search tool. This integration aims to efficiently process complex mathematical operations and diverse inquiries, dynamically assessing the nature of user prompts to determine the most suitable processing approach—whether through calculation, LLM-based processing, or an internet search.

## Components

- **Large Language Model (LLM):** Acts as the primary interface for understanding and parsing user prompts, leveraging its capabilities to handle non-mathematical queries and perform textual analysis.
- **Calculator:** A computational tool tasked with executing precise mathematical operations, interfaced with the LLM for handling direct numerical queries or operations.
- **Search Tool:** Employs Google Search APIs (e.g., Serp API) to extend the system’s capability in retrieving real-time information from the web, applicable for inquiries that fall outside the LLM’s knowledge base or require up-to-date data.

## Workflow

1. **Inquiry Reception:** The LLM initially receives and analyzes the user prompt to understand the query's context and requirements.
2. **Path Determination:** The system evaluates the nature of the query to decide the processing path:
    - Mathematical operations are directed to the Calculator.
    - Textual or contextual inquiries are processed within the LLM.
    - Queries requiring current information or data outside the LLM's training scope are redirected to the Google Search via Serp API or a similar service.
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the chosen path, the system processes the inquiry and generates an appropriate response.
4. **Integration and Feedback:** The LLM integrates the output from the calculator or search tool, if used, to provide a comprehensive response to the user. Feedback mechanisms refine decision-making for future inquiries.

## Tools

- **Flowise AI or LangFlow:** Considered for implementing the LLM and workflow integration.
- **Google Search APIs (e.g., Serp API):** For executing web searches as part of the workflow.

## Goal

Our aim is to create a versatile and efficient processing agent that leverages the strengths of each component—LLM, calculator, and search tool—to accurately address a wide range of user inquiries. This enhances user experience and information accuracy.
